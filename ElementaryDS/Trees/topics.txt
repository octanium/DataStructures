create a BT
Traverse(pre, in, post, level order traversal)
1. Using recursion
2. Using stack
3. Morris Traversal(Threaded BT): Types: (Right threaded(inorder successor), Left threaded(inorder predecessor), fully threaded)
   (TBT are used when there are more of traversal operations and less insertion/deletion, becuase insertion/deletion is complex, we can also use them if stack/queue space is limited and our tree can be larger)
   3.1 Create a Threaded BT
   3.2 Traverse in O(1) space
Insert in a BT.
Delete in a BT.
