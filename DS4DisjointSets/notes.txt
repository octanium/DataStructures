3 operations
Make-Set- create sets of each vertex, initially n vertex = n sets
Union- merge two sets into one
Find-set: Find set of a particular vertex

Can only be applied to undirected graphs

applications
1. Kruskal Algo
2. Detect cycle in undirected graphs

Optimisation  techniques
1. Path compression( performed in find opn )
2. Union by rank( performed in union opn ). Rank is the height of the tree. Our aim is to have minimum heigtht of the combined tree.
   Height of tree after union of tree A and tree B = max(height-A, height-B)
   hence if tree-A has height 3(or rank 2) and tree-B has height 2(or rank 1) then make tree A as a parent of tree B
Complexity after Optimisation = O(alpha(n))
alapha(n) <= 4, called as inverse Ackkerman function
