3 operations
Make-Set- create sets of each vertex, initially n vertex = n sets
Union- merge two sets into one
Find-set: Find set of a particular vertex

Can only be applied to undirected graphs

applications
1. Kruskal Algo
2. Detect cycle in undirected graphs

Optimisation  techniques
1. Path compression( performed in find opn )
2. Union by rank( performed in union opn )
Complexity after Optimisation = O(alpha(n))
alapha(n) <= 4, called as inverse Ackkerman function
